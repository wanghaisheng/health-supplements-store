## Getting Started

**Note:**
This repository contains the client-side code for the Auto Marketplace project. However, the backend code is currently private and not included in this repository. As a result, you won't be able to run the project locally without the backend.

If you are interested in exploring the client-side code or contributing to the project, feel free to do so. Keep in mind that a fully functional local setup requires the backend, which is not publicly available at the moment.

## Prerequisites

To run the project locally, you need to have the backend set up separately. For access to the backend code and further details, please contact the project maintainers.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to contribute to the client-side code or have questions about the project, please follow our [contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
