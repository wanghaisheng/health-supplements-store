-   Description of the issue, including steps to reproduce.
-   Version of the project where the issue was discovered.
-   Your name and contact information (optional).

We will respond to security incidents as quickly as possible and keep you informed of our progress.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a vulnerability, we kindly request that you:

-   Notify us privately, providing sufficient details for us to reproduce and address the issue.
-   Avoid disclosing the issue publicly until we have had a chance to address it.
-   Do not exploit the vulnerability for malicious purposes.

We appreciate your help in keeping our project secure.
